# Calendar Integration

TaskNotes provides calendar integration through OAuth-connected calendar services, two Bases-powered calendar views, and read-only ICS calendar subscriptions.

## OAuth Calendar Integration

TaskNotes supports bidirectional synchronization with Google Calendar and Microsoft Outlook using OAuth authentication. This integration allows you to view external calendar events alongside your tasks and sync changes back to the calendar provider.

### Supported Providers

- **Google Calendar** - OAuth 2.0 authentication with access to all calendars in your Google account
- **Microsoft Outlook** - OAuth 2.0 authentication with access to calendars in your Microsoft 365 or Outlook.com account

### Setup Requirements

OAuth calendar integration requires creating an OAuth application with your calendar provider. This process takes approximately 15 minutes per provider. You will need to:

1. Create an OAuth application in Google Cloud Console or Microsoft Azure Portal
2. Configure redirect URIs and scopes
3. Obtain client ID and client secret
4. Enter credentials in TaskNotes settings (`Settings -> TaskNotes -> Integrations`, OAuth calendar section)

### Synchronization Behavior

- Events are fetched automatically every 15 minutes
- Events are also fetched when local changes occur (task creation, updates, rescheduling)
- Dragging calendar events to new dates/times updates the event in the calendar provider
- Choose which calendars are fetched in [Integrations settings](../settings/integrations.md#choosing-calendars); per-view toggles in calendar views then hide or show the fetched calendars
- ICS subscriptions, Google, and Microsoft calendars load independently at startup, so a slow source does not delay the others
- Access tokens are automatically refreshed when expired
- Globally disabled calendars are excluded from the combined event data, not just hidden in a view
- Connecting Microsoft starts an initial fetch and automatic refresh; disconnecting removes its cached calendars, events, and sync state
- Google manual refresh reports calendar fetch failures, including partial failures. Successful calendars still update, while failed calendars retain their previous data; failed refreshes can be retried immediately

### Google Calendar Task Availability

Under **Settings → TaskNotes → Integrations → Export tasks to Google Calendar**, enable **Show all-day task events as free** to prevent all-day task exports from blocking your availability. This includes date-only tasks and timed tasks converted by **Create as all-day events**. Timed exports remain Busy.

The option is off by default. Changes apply when tasks are exported or updated. Run **Sync all tasks** to update existing eligible task events. Disabling the option makes exported task events Busy again on their next full sync. This setting does not affect unrelated calendar events.

### Token Management

TaskNotes stores OAuth client credentials, access tokens, and refresh tokens in Obsidian Secret Storage, which is encrypted at rest when supported by the operating system and kept separate from TaskNotes' `data.json`. Tokens are refreshed automatically before expiration. You can revoke account access or forget the saved OAuth app credentials through the integrations settings.

## Calendar Views

TaskNotes provides Calendar and Mini Calendar views that display tasks alongside OAuth calendar events and ICS subscriptions. Both views support drag-and-drop scheduling.

For detailed view documentation, see [Calendar Views](../views/calendar-views.md).

Notes linked from recurring external calendar events can be matched either across the loaded event series or only to the selected recurrence instance. Configure this in [Integrations settings](../settings/integrations.md#calendar-subscriptions-ics).

## Time Entry Editor

TaskNotes includes a time entry editor for tracking time spent on tasks. Time entries are created and managed through the Calendar View.

### Creating Time Entries

To create a time entry on the Calendar View:

1. Click and drag on a time slot in the calendar to select a time range
2. When the selection menu appears, choose **Create time entry** (timeblock appears only if the feature is enabled)
3. Choose a task in the task selector modal
4. A time entry is created for that task with the selected start/end range

Time entries are always associated with a specific task and stored in that task's frontmatter. Multiple time entries can exist for one task.

### Managing Time Entries

The time entry editor modal provides functions to:

- View all time entries for a task
- Edit the start time, end time, and duration of time entries
- Delete time entries
- See the total time tracked across all entries for a task

Access the time entry editor by clicking an existing time entry in the calendar.

## ICS Calendar Subscriptions

TaskNotes can subscribe to external calendar feeds using the iCalendar (ICS) format. This provides read-only access to events from calendar services. ICS subscriptions differ from OAuth calendar integration in that they are read-only—dragging ICS events to new dates does not update the source calendar.

Add and manage ICS subscriptions from `Settings -> TaskNotes -> Integrations` (Calendar Subscriptions section).

Recurring subscriptions load a bounded window from 30 days ago through one year ahead, with at most 3,000 retained instances per series. Historical occurrences do not consume that visible-instance limit. Non-recurring events are not affected by this window.

Google recurring-task exports include completion, skip, and moved-original exclusions only when those dates belong to the exported recurrence. All-day exports use their date-only start when validating exclusions.

Cancelled events are hidden. A guest declining an invitation does not hide the meeting. When a feed's `X-WR-CALNAME` is an email address (as in many personal Google Calendar feeds), TaskNotes matches that address to the owner's `ATTENDEE` response and hides meetings they declined. Recurring exceptions can override the series response. If the feed does not identify the owner, TaskNotes keeps events visible rather than guessing whose response applies. This does not use the subscription's display name. Refresh the subscription after updating to restore previously hidden meetings.

For details on creating notes and tasks from calendar events, see [ICS Integration](ics-integration.md).

## Time Blocking

The Calendar View supports time blocking for scheduling dedicated work periods. To create a time block:

1. Click and drag on a time slot in the calendar to select a time range
2. A context menu will appear with available options
3. Select "Create timeblock" from the menu (this option only appears if timeblocking is enabled in settings)

Time blocks are stored in the frontmatter of daily notes and can be linked to specific tasks. This differs from time entries, which track actual time spent and are stored in task frontmatter rather than daily notes.

Enable time blocking under `Settings -> TaskNotes -> Features` (Timeblocking section).
