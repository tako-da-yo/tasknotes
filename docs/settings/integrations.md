# Integrations Settings

These settings control the integration with other plugins and services, such as Bases and external calendars.

## Bases

TaskNotes v4 uses Obsidian's Bases core plugin for its main views. For setup instructions, see [Core Concepts](../core-concepts.md#bases-integration).

### View Commands Configuration

View command settings map TaskNotes commands and ribbon actions to specific `.base` files. This is useful when you maintain custom variants of the default views and want first-class command access to those files.

Access these settings in **Settings → TaskNotes → General → Views & base files**.

Default mappings:

- **Open Mini Calendar View** → `TaskNotes/Views/mini-calendar-default.base`
- **Open Kanban View** → `TaskNotes/Views/kanban-default.base`
- **Open Tasks View** → `TaskNotes/Views/tasks-default.base`
- **Open Calendar View** → `TaskNotes/Views/calendar-default.base`
- **Open Agenda View** → `TaskNotes/Views/agenda-default.base`
- **Pomodoro Statistics Base** → `TaskNotes/Views/pomodoro-stats.base`
- **Relationships Widget** → `TaskNotes/Views/relationships.base`

Each command allows you to specify a custom `.base` file path and includes a reset button to restore the default path.

**Auto-create default files**: When enabled, TaskNotes creates missing default `.base` files automatically on startup.

**Create files**: Button to generate all default `.base` files in the `TaskNotes/Views/` directory. Existing files are not overwritten.

The generated Pomodoro statistics Base reads Pomodoro sessions from daily notes frontmatter. If your Pomodoro history is still stored in plugin data, migrate it from **Settings → TaskNotes → Features** before using that Base file.

## OAuth Calendar Integration

Connect Google Calendar or Microsoft Outlook to sync events bidirectionally with TaskNotes. Events automatically refresh every 15 minutes and sync when local changes are made (such as dragging events to reschedule).

Enable **Disable calendar integrations on mobile** when you sync TaskNotes settings between desktop and mobile but do not want Obsidian Mobile to load external calendars on startup. The setting only affects mobile devices; desktop calendar integrations continue to run normally.

### Setup Requirements

OAuth integration requires creating your own OAuth application with Google and/or Microsoft. Initial setup takes approximately 15 minutes per provider.

**Setup Guide**: See [Calendar Integration Setup](../calendar-setup.md) for detailed instructions on creating OAuth credentials with Google Cloud Console and Azure Portal.

### Google Calendar

Provide **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from Google Cloud Console, then use **Connect Google Calendar** to complete OAuth loopback authentication. **Disconnect** revokes account tokens while retaining the OAuth app credentials for reconnection. Use **Forget saved credentials** to remove the client ID and client secret.

The **Target calendar** setting used for exporting tasks to Google Calendar is also used as the default selection when creating a manual external calendar event from the calendar view. If the target calendar is unavailable, TaskNotes falls back to the provider's primary calendar.

For timed task exports, **Default reminder** accepts one or more minute offsets separated by commas, such as `60, 1440`. All-day task exports use the target Google Calendar's default reminder settings.

When connected, displays:
- Connected account email
- Connection time
- Last sync time
- Manual refresh button
- A toggle for each calendar on the account (see [Choosing calendars](#choosing-calendars))

### Microsoft Outlook Calendar

Provide **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from Azure App Registration, then use **Connect Microsoft Calendar** to authenticate. **Disconnect** revokes account tokens while retaining the OAuth app credentials for reconnection. Use **Forget saved credentials** to remove the client ID and client secret.

When connected, displays:
- Connected account email
- Connection time
- Last sync time
- A toggle for each calendar on the account (see [Choosing calendars](#choosing-calendars))

### Choosing calendars

After connecting, turn on the calendars you want in the connected Google or Microsoft card. Calendars are off until you turn them on, including calendars shared with you later. Only selected calendars are fetched, and only they appear in calendar view toggles. If an account was already connected when you updated to a version with calendar selection, all of its calendars stay selected; turn off the ones you do not need.

### Google event types

Google Calendar marks some entries as special event types. The calendar view gives each type its own look, in the calendar's color:

| Event type | Appearance | CSS class |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Working location | Faded marker with a house symbol in the all-day row; timed working locations are a light tint behind the day's other events. Working locations can't be clicked, dragged, or edited. | `fc-google-event--working-location` |
| Out of office | Hatched block | `fc-google-event--out-of-office` |
| Focus time | Dim tint with a double bar on the left | `fc-google-event--focus-time` |
| Birthday | Cake marker before the title | `fc-google-event--birthday` |
| Events from Gmail | Envelope marker before the title | `fc-google-event--from-gmail` |

To change a type's appearance or hide it, target its class in a CSS snippet. For example, `.fc-google-event--working-location { display: none; }` hides working location events.

### Security

- OAuth client credentials and account tokens are stored in Obsidian Secret Storage, which is encrypted at rest when supported by the operating system
- OAuth credentials and account tokens are not written to TaskNotes' `data.json`
- Access tokens refresh automatically
- Calendar data syncs directly between Obsidian and the calendar provider (no intermediary servers)
- Disconnect at any time to revoke account access; use **Forget saved credentials** to remove the OAuth app credentials

## Calendar subscriptions (ICS)

ICS settings define how subscribed calendar events are represented in your vault. You can set a default template, destination folder, filename strategy, and custom filename template for generated notes. Use **Add Calendar Subscription** to register URLs or local files, and **Refresh all subscriptions** for manual synchronization.

**Recurring event related notes** controls how notes linked from recurring external calendar events are matched. **Series-wide** keeps the current behavior: a note linked to one loaded recurrence can appear on the other loaded recurrences from the same Google, Microsoft, or ICS event series. **Selected instance only** limits related notes and counts to the exact recurrence instance that was linked.

## Automatic ICS export

Automatic export keeps an ICS feed of your tasks updated on a schedule. Configure whether it is enabled, where the file is written (vault-relative path), the refresh interval, and use **Export now** for immediate output.

Export filters can omit archived tasks, completed tasks, tasks without due dates, or tasks without scheduled dates. When both due-date and scheduled-date requirements are enabled, exported tasks must have both dates.

## HTTP API

HTTP API settings control the local server lifecycle, listening port, and request authentication token.

Changes to API enablement or port require an Obsidian restart to take effect.

!!! warning
    The HTTP API binds to loopback only and browser CORS is limited to loopback and supported extension origins. Authentication is required for HTTP API and MCP requests. If the token is empty when the server starts, TaskNotes generates and saves one. Copy it into your clients' authentication settings; clearing it does not enable unauthenticated access.

## Webhooks

- **Add Webhook**: Register a new webhook endpoint.
